Some basic guidelines on setting up port forwarding from a port on the upstream IP address
exposed to the WAN to a port in a node in a private network (LAN).

Using the default firmware of the widely-used wifi routers can be risky, as most
commonly they contain backdoors. The usage of ddwrt and OpenWRT open source
firmware for networking devices is encouraged when using general purpose wifi
routers.

1. Retrieve MAC address of the device in your private network to which you would like to
set port-forwarding to.

This can be achieved via the ifconfig or ip commands.

The identifiers of networking interfaces on a Debian/Ubuntu machine for ethernet
and wireless ports are prefixed by default as follows:

- eth
- wlan

Example networking interface names: eth0, wlan0, eth1 and so forth.

The identifiers of networking interfaces on a Debian/Ubuntu machine for ethernet
and wireless ports are prefixed by default as follows:

- enp
- wlan

Example networking interface names: enp0s1, wlan0 and so forth.

The MAC address can be found after HWaddr in the ifconfig output.

2. Setup DHCP daemon of router to give a specific predefined IP address to this
hardware address
each time an IP address is requested by a networking interface using it.
In this way if a reboot is needed to be performed, the server in the local
area network will be granted the same IP address each time.

3. Set port forwarding to a port on this IP address.
Let say your upstream IP address in the WAN is
120.134.15.257. You can set port forwarding from the upstream IP
to one of the ports on the IP address you selected to be
given to your server each time it requests one(e.g. 192.168.18.19)

120.134.15.257:80 => 192.168.18.19:120

In this way a request to port 80 on 120.134.15.257 in the WAN
will be port forwarded to port 120 of the interface using
the IP address 192.168.18.19 on your inner network.
